# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used to choose the best combination among five Scores evaluated with five different rules. The problem had a search space of (25−1)∗5 = 155) possibilities and the objective was to find the best final decision rule. We used a database with 153,400 customers labeled in a binary form as 1 that is likely to be directed to a differentiated service in the Call Center and 0 otherwise. The fitness evaluation of the model was the VP (true positive) obtained via the cutoff point of the 50,000 customers with the highest final score. Crossover and Mutation probability simulations were performed and selection was made via elitism, always keeping the fittest individuals in the population. The final combination found presented a fitness superior to the market benchmark technique.
